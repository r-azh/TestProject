# asyncio provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access
#  over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitivesâ€œ

# In the blocking of processing, the solicitor blocks the result until its solicitation is fulfilled.
# A non-blocking operator is one that, at a minimal blocking sign, returns
# a control code or exception that tells the solicitor to retry later.

# Asynchronous operations notify the end of solicitations by means of callbacks, coroutines, and other mechanisms.
# A callback function is a function that is called when a certain condition occurs. It is commonly used to handle
#  results from asynchronous processing.


# Polling functions: The polling technique is implemented by different operating systems aiming to
# monitor the status of one or more resource descriptors. Systems implement this
# technique by means of functions. Polling functions form the basis of event loops.
