# . Python supports a feature called function closures which means that inner functions defined in non-global
#  scope remember what their enclosing namespaces looked like at definition time. This can be seen by looking
#  at the func_closure attribute of our inner function which contains the variables in the enclosing scopes.
# The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are summarized in the following points:
# -We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
# -The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
# -The enclosing function must return the nested function.

times3 = make_multiplier_of(3)
times5 = make_multiplier_of(5)
print(times5(times3(2)))

# All function objects have a __closure__ attribute that returns a tuple of cell objects if it is a closure function.
#  Referring to the example above, we know times3 and times5 are closure functions.

print(make_multiplier_of.__closure__)
print(times3.__closure__)
print(times5.__closure__)

# The cell object has the attribute cell_contents which stores the closed value.

print(times3.__closure__[0].cell_contents)
print(times5.__closure__[0].cell_contents)

#  closures - the fact that functions remember their enclosing scope - can be used to build custom functions that have,
#  essentially, a hard coded argument.
# And the uses are numerous - if you are familiar with the key parameter in Pythonâ€™s sorted function you have probably
# written a lambda function to sort a list of lists by the second item instead of the first. You might now be able to
# write an itemgetter function that accepts the index to retrieve and returns a function that could suitably be passed
# to the key parameter.
