# The most difficult design constraint is that we want most of the code in the system to be unaware that it potentially
# is dealing with multiple currencies. One possible strategy is to immediately convert all money values into a reference
# currency. However, this doesn't allow exchange rates to vary easily.
# Instead we would like a solution that lets us conveniently represent multiple exchange rates, and still allows most
# arithmetic-like expressions to look like, well, arithmetic.
# Objects to the rescue. When the object we have doesn't behave the way we want it to, we make another object with the
# same external protocol (an imposter) but a different implementation.
# This probably sounds a bit like magic. How do we know to think of creating an imposter here? I won't kid youâ€”there is
# no formula for flashes of design insight. Ward Cunningham came up with the "trick" a decade ago, and I haven't seen it
# independently duplicated yet, so it must be a pretty tricky trick. TDD can't guarantee that we will have flashes of
# insight at the right moment. However, confidence-giving tests and carefully factored code give us preparation for
# insight, and preparation for applying that insight when it comes. p37

# That doesn't seem like enough reasons to tip the scales permanently, but it is enough for me to start in this
# direction. I'm also perfectly willing to move responsibility for reduction to  Expression if it turns out that
#  Bank s don't need to be involved.
