# The threading module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods:
# threading.activeCount(): Returns the number of thread objects that are active.
# threading.currentThread(): Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.
# threading.enumerate(): Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.
#
# In addition to the methods, the threading module has the Thread class that implements threading. The methods provided
#  by the Thread class are as follows:
# run(): The run() method is the entry point for a thread.
# start(): The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.
# join([time]): The join() waits for threads to terminate.
# isAlive(): The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.
# getName(): The getName() method returns the name of a thread.
# setName(): The setName() method sets the name of a thread.


# To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following âˆ’
# - Define a new subclass of the Thread class.
# - Override the __init__(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.
# - Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.
# Once you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by
#  invoking the start(), which in turn calls run() method.
